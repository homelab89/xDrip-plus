        WARNING: Database restore is rarely necessary and may cause SEVERE DATA LOSS.\n\n
        Protect your data by uploading to Nightscout or Tidepool.\n\n
        When switching phones, importing settings (alerts, colors, etc.) is usually sufficient. Restoring the database is typically unnecessary unless you need short-term access to historical data (for example, before a medical visit).\n\n\n
        Instructions:\n\n
        - Place the database in the \'xdrip\' folder. If it doesn\’t exist, perform an export once to create it.\n\n
        - Restart this restore routine.\n\n
        - Select the correct database and follow the on-screen instructions.
